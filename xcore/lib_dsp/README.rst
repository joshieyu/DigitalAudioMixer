=====================

:Version: 6.3.0
:Vendor: XMOS

Summary
-------

This API reference manual describes the XMOS fixed-point digital signal processing
software library.  The library implements of a suite of common signal processing functions
for use on XMOS xCORE-200 multicore microcontrollers.

Required tools
..............

* xTIMEcomposer Tools Version 14.2.1 or later

Required hardware
.................

Only XMOS xCORE-200 based multicore microcontrollers are supported with this library.
The previous generation XS1 based multicore microntrollers are not supported.

The xCORE-200 has a single cycle 32x32->64 bit multiply/accumulate unit,
single cycle double-word load and store, dual issue instruction execution,
and other instruction set enhancements.
These features make xCORE-200 an efficient platform for executing
digital signal processing algorithms.

Prerequisites
.............
